The parking model of `parking.tex` and its divisible-sandpile analogue.

How the paper's objects are modelled here (`parking.tex`, Sections 1 and 3):

- The particle–hole process, its labelled particles, the instruction stacks
  and the uniform variables are `LatticeProb.ParticleHole`.  A realization is
  driven by the triple `(η, stack, rank)`; the law of the triple is the product
  of the i.i.d. law of `η`, the stack law of the walk, and independent uniforms.
- `U_n(x)` is the number of departures from `x` in the first `n` rounds,
  `A_t(x)` the active particles at `x` after round `t`, and `S_t` the expected
  number of particles started at the origin still active after round `t`.
- The divisible sandpile odometer is `u_{n+1} = (η + P u_n)⁺` with `u_0 = 0`,
  for the simple random walk operator `P`; the oriented version uses the
  transpose kernel `P⃗(x, x - e_i) = 1/d`, as Remark 3.1 of the paper requires.
- `U_∞(x)` is the supremum of `U_n(x)` in `ℕ∞`, so that a site which never
  stops receiving particles has the value `⊤` and not a junk one.
