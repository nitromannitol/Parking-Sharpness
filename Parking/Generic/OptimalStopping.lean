The homogeneity of `sSup` under a nonnegative scalar, for the set of values an abstract
optimal-stopping problem's admissible rules produce.  Stated for an arbitrary `Set ℝ` (the
image of the set of values under multiplication by the reward's scale is the scale times the
supremum), so this module can move verbatim into the shared library.  The scaling of the value
of a terminal-reward stopping problem, `sSup ((c * F) '' rules) = c * sSup (F '' rules)`, is an
instance of this with `S` the set of terminal values.
