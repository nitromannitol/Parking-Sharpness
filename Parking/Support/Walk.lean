The simple random walk that Sections 3 to 5 of `parking.tex` run beside the
particle system, its bounded optimal stopping problem, and the truncated
Green function.

How the paper's objects are modelled here:

- A trajectory is driven by a sequence of signed directions in
  `Fin d × Bool`; `walkPath x p j` is `X_j` under `P_x`.  The law of the
  directions is the uniform product measure `walkLaw d`, so that `E_x f` is
  `∫ p, f (walkPath x p) ∂(walkLaw d)`.  For `d = 0` the one-step law is the
  zero measure, which is why every statement below fixes `1 ≤ d`.
- A stopping time bounded by `n` for the natural filtration of the walk is a
  function of the direction sequence which is bounded by `n` and depends only
  on the directions read before it stops; that is the content of
  `IsStoppingTimeLE`.
- `stopReward η x σ p` is `∑_{j<σ} η(X_j)` along one trajectory, so the
  quantity the paper's supremum ranges over is `stopValue η x σ`.
- `heat d j x` is `P^j(0, x)` and `green d m x` is
  `g_m(x) = ∑_{j<m} P^j(0,x)`; `gamma d m y` is the paper's `Γ_m(y)`.
- `kappa d n` is `κ_d(n)`.
