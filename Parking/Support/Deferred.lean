Lemma 3.2 of `parking.tex`, first clause: the event that the odometer at `y`
has reached `j + 1` does not depend on the instruction of index `j` at `y`.

The whole content is `state_congr`: the state after `t` rounds reads only the
instructions the odometer has reached, so two drivers agreeing on those, on the
configuration and on the uniform variables have the same state.  The bound
`instructionIndex_lt` is what makes that true: a particle active at `y` reads
an index between the departures from `y` before and after the round, because
its own label is one of the labels at `y` that the round counts.  That in turn
needs the instructions to move a particle to a neighbour, without which a
particle can stand at a site it is not a candidate for and read an index the
round does not count.

The clause follows: if the odometer at `y` never reaches `j + 1`, then no
instruction of index `j` at `y` is ever read, the two states agree, and the
odometers agree.
