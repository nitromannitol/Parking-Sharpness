/-
The particle-driven construction of the process, in which every particle
carries its own walk and its own uniform variables.  This is the construction
`parking.tex` couples in `lem:one-particle` and `lem:tagged-monotonicity`,
where "every particle they share" gets "the same walk and the same uniform
variables"; the stack construction of `LatticeProb.ParticleHole` cannot express
that coupling, because adding a particle at a site changes which instruction
each later departure from that site reads.

The two constructions differ only in where a departing particle goes: here the
particle labelled `p` moves by the direction `move (p, t)` in round `t + 1`,
whereas in the stack construction it reads the next unread instruction at its
site.  Rounds, settling, holes and the odometer are defined exactly as there,
so the two processes share the state type and every derived count.

Raising the configuration by one at a single site is `addParticle`: it adds the
label `(x₀, η(x₀)⁺)` when `η(x₀) ≥ 0`, and removes one hole at `x₀` otherwise.
Either way the labels of the particles already present, and their moves and
uniform variables, are untouched, which is the coupling of `lem:one-particle`.
