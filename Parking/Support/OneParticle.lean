Lemma 3.3 of `parking.tex`: adding one particle to the configuration changes
the state by exactly one active particle at one site, or by exactly one
unfilled hole at one site, and never by both.

The discrepancy is carried through the rounds as `OneParticleInv`: either the
second process has one active particle the first has not and the holes agree,
or the actives agree and the first process has one unfilled hole the second has
not.  The base case splits on the sign of the count at the site: raising a
nonnegative count adds the next label there and leaves the holes alone, raising
a negative one cancels a hole and leaves the actives alone.

The step is a count.  Writing `A` for the arrivals at the site in question and
`h` for the holes there, `min(|A|, h)` of the arrivals settle, and the ones
that do not are those the round's order puts at rank `h` or above
(`settledIn`, `card_settledIn`).  Adding an arrival cannot make a survivor
settle, and neither can removing a hole (`survivors_subset_insert`,
`survivors_subset_holes`), so the survivors of the second process contain those
of the first, and the two counts decide which case holds:

- from the extra particle, at the site it reaches: if `|A| + 1 ≤ h` every
  arrival settles in both and the second process is left one hole short; if
  `h ≤ |A|` both fill all `h` holes and exactly one particle is left over;
- from the extra hole, at its site: if `|A| ≤ h - 1` every arrival settles in
  both and the extra hole survives; if `h ≤ |A|` one common particle settles
  only in the first process.

Where exactly one particle is left over, `eq_insert_of_card_succ` names it, and
nothing in the argument has to say which particle that is.
