The one-particle coupling of `parking.tex`, Section 3: the process started from
`η` beside the process started from `η` with one more particle at `x₀`, every
other particle keeping its walk and its uniform variables.

`tagged_invariant` is what an induction over the rounds proves and what
`lem:tagged-monotonicity` reads off: a particle active in the first process is
active in the second and stands where it stands there, and the second process
has no more unfilled holes anywhere.  The two halves feed each other.  A
particle active in the first process is among the arrivals of the second, so
the arrivals of the first are arrivals of the second; a particle that does not
settle in the first has at least as many arrivals of smaller rank ahead of it
in the second and finds no more holes there, so it does not settle in the
second either; and the holes, which shrink by the number of arrivals, stay
below.  Nothing in the argument reads the order on the labels beyond the fact
that both processes break ties by the same rule.
