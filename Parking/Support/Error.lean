The error field `w` of `eq:error-recursion`, its maximal average `w^\star`,
and the conditional expectations given the initial configuration that
Sections 3 and 4 of `parking.tex` use.

- `wErr ω k x` is `w_k(x)`: `w_0 = 0` and `w_{k+1}(x) = (P w_k)(x) +
  ∑_{y ∼ x}(I_{y,x}(U_k(y)) - U_k(y)/(2d))`.
- `wStar ω n x` is `w_n^\star(x) = E_x max_{0 ≤ j ≤ n}|w_{n-j}(X_j)|`, an
  average over the independent walk alone, so it is still a function of the
  realization.
- Conditioning on `η` is integration over the stacks and the uniform variables
  with `η` held fixed, which is what `meanUgiven` and `probGiven` do.  The law
  of the data is a product, so these are versions of the conditional
  expectation and the conditional probability given `η`.
- `shiftConf v` is the translation of a configuration by `v`; a law is
  translation invariant when it is invariant under every `shiftConf`.
