Integrating a differential inequality.

Step 3 of `thm:subcritical` (`parking.tex:2478-2492`) integrates the
logarithmic derivative of `φ(λ) = Ê_λ F` over `[0, λ₁]`.  Dividing by `φ` is
not needed and is not done here: if `G` is any antiderivative of `g` vanishing
at zero, the product `φ e^{-G/3}` has nonnegative derivative exactly when
`g φ ≤ 3 φ'`, so it is nondecreasing and the bound at `0` follows from the
value at `λ₁`.  This form does not assume `φ` positive, which is what makes the
case `φ(0) = 0` of the paper's proof unnecessary.

The antiderivative `G` is supplied as data because the function to be integrated
is continuous only on `[0, λ₁]`: composing it with the clamp of `ℝ` onto
`[0, λ₁]` makes it continuous everywhere, so `u ↦ ∫₀^u` of the clamped function
is differentiable at every point, agrees with the paper's integral at `λ₁`, and
is the `G` the inequality above wants.
