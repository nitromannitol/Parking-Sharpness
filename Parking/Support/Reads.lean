Which instructions a realization of the stack construction has read.

`Parking.Support.Deferred` cuts the instructions a state depends on by their
INDEX: the state after `t` rounds reads only the instructions of index below
the odometer.  What the passage to the particle-driven construction needs is
the converse, that every index below the odometer IS read, and by exactly one
departure.  With that, "the instruction `(z, i)` is unread through round `t`"
and "`i` is at least the odometer at `z`" are the same condition, and
overwriting an unread instruction changes nothing.

Also here: the instruction index a particle reads, and the pair of site and
index it reads, are measurable functions of the driving data.  Only the state
was proved measurable in `Parking.Support.Measurability`; the index is the sum
of the odometer at the position, read at a variable site, and the number of
co-departing particles with a smaller label.
