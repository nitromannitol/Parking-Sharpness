/- The weak limit of the rescaled odometer from the truncated problems.

`prop:oriented-scaling` is reduced by `Parking.oriented_scaling_of_weak_one` to a single
analytic statement: the laws of `n^{-1/4} u_n(0)` converge weakly on the line.  The paper's
proof (`parking.tex:3192-3203`) produces that convergence only at a FIXED spatial cutoff
level: both rewards of the cited stability estimate must be bounded by one constant, and the
limiting field, a Gaussian field on the line conditionally on the noise, is almost surely
unbounded in space, so the cutoff level cannot grow with `n`.  The passage from the truncated
problems to the odometer itself is the `A → ∞` step, and it is a soft argument: for every
cutoff level the truncated variables converge in law, the truncation error is uniformly small
in `L¹`, and the family has uniformly bounded means.

That is what this file proves.  Convergence against bounded Lipschitz test functions is stable
under a uniform `L¹` perturbation, so the integrals of those test functions form Cauchy
sequences and converge; the uniform bound on the means makes the laws tight, so Prokhorov's
theorem gives a limit point, and a limit point against which every bounded Lipschitz integral
converges is the weak limit.  No continuum object is built: the limiting law is produced by
compactness, and the convergence is then read against all bounded continuous test functions.
