The extended continuous mapping theorem.

Let `X_n → X` in law as random elements of a metric space `E`, and let
`f_n, f : E → ℝ` be Borel functions such that `f_n(x_n) → f(x)` whenever
`x_n → x` in `E`.  Then `f_n(X_n) → f(X)` in law.  This is van der Vaart,
*Asymptotic Statistics*, Theorem 18.11, and Billingsley, *Convergence of
Probability Measures*, Theorem 5.5.

The proof is the closed-set half of the portmanteau theorem and nothing else;
no coupling and no Skorokhod representation are used.  For `F ⊆ ℝ` closed put
`S_k = ⋃_{n ≥ k} f_n⁻¹(F)` and `B_k = closure(S_k)`.  Then
`limsup_n P(f_n(X_n) ∈ F) ≤ limsup_n P(X_n ∈ B_k) ≤ P(X ∈ B_k)` for every `k`,
the sets `B_k` decrease, and `⋂_k B_k ⊆ f⁻¹(F)`, so
`limsup_n P(f_n(X_n) ∈ F) ≤ P(f(X) ∈ F)`.

The last inclusion is where the hypothesis on `f_n` enters, and it uses only
its local uniform form: if `f(x) ∉ F` then an `ε`-ball about `f(x)` misses `F`,
and a `δ`-ball about `x` on which `|f_n − f(x)| ≤ ε/2` for all `n ≥ N` misses
`S_N`, so `x ∉ B_N`.  The local uniform form is proved here to follow from the
sequential one in any metric space.

/-- **The sequential hypothesis of the extended continuous mapping theorem
implies its local uniform form.**  If `f_n(x_n) → f(x)` for every sequence
`x_n → x`, then for every `x` and every `ε > 0` there are a radius `δ > 0` and
a threshold `N` beyond which `f_n` stays within `ε` of `f(x)` on the whole
`δ`-ball about `x`.  No separability or completeness is used. -/
