The two pathwise identities of Section 3 of `parking.tex` that the averaged
statements rest on.

`U_eq_sum_A` is that the odometer is the running total of the active counts,
which is what turns `E U_n(0) = ∑_{s<n} S_s` into `E A_s(0) = S_s` summed.

`signed_count` is `eq:signed-count`: at every site the active particles minus
the unfilled holes are the initial count plus the arrivals minus the
departures.  It follows from the parallel identity and from the holes being
what is left of the initial ones after the arrivals, because a positive and a
negative part are never both positive.
