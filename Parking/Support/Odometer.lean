/-
The two conservation facts of one round that `lem:parallel` rests on, and the
bridge from the neighbour hypothesis of that lemma to the step bound of
`LatticeProb.ParticleHoleLemmas`.

- `activeCount_zero`: at time zero the active particles at `x` are exactly the
  `η(x)⁺` particles that start there.
- `activeCount_succ`: the particles active at `x` after round `t + 1` are the
  arrivals of that round that did not settle.
- `stepsToNeighbour_of_mem`: an instruction that points at a neighbour of the
  site carrying it moves a particle by at most one in each coordinate, which is
  what makes the counts over `candidates` lossless.

The third ingredient of `lem:parallel`, that the instruction indices read at a
site in one round are exactly `[U_t(y), U_{t+1}(y))`, is
`Parking.card_filter_nextPos` in `Parking/Support/Parallel.lean`.
